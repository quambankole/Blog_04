                    Artificial intelligence's societal impact is uncertain but potentially
                    positive and challenging. Challenges include job displacement, ethical concerns,
                    and data privacy. AI's transformative influence necessitates discussions on
                    economic, legal, and political issues. Concerns about super-intelligent machines
                    exist, along with unintended consequences. Ensuring ethical AI use is crucial.
                    AI offers workplace efficiency, frees humans from repetitive tasks, and enhances
                    healthcare with cost savings and improved patient care. It can reduce traffic
                    congestion, aid crime solving, and impact daily life. Expectations lean towards
                    AI's generally positive societal impact, though challenges remain.</p>

                <h2>An Argument That Video Games Are, Indeed, High Art</h2>

                <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2015/10/13/an-argument-that-video-games-are-indeed-high-art/?sh=442b010d7b3c">Article link</a>

                    In the last two decades, video games have transformed their purpose and
                    perception. Before 1994, they were primarily seen as time-wasting competitive
                    electronic amusements, often targeting teenage boys with spare change or parents
                    with gaming systems. This led many to dismiss them as mere digitized games,
                    arguing that if chess and basketball aren't considered art, neither should games
                    like Pong or Madden Football. Roger Ebert, a prominent film critic, vehemently
                    opposed the idea of video games as art from 2006 until his death in 2013,
                    stating that no game could compare to great poets, filmmakers, novelists, or
                    artists.
