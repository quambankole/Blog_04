                    Artificial intelligence's societal impact is uncertain but potentially positive
                    and challenging. Challenges include job displacement, ethical concerns, and data
                    privacy. AI's transformative influence necessitates discussions on economic,
                    legal, and political issues. Concerns about super-intelligent machines exist,
                    along with unintended consequences. Ensuring ethical AI use is crucial. AI
                    offers workplace efficiency, frees humans from repetitive tasks, and enhances
                    healthcare with cost savings and improved patient care. It can reduce traffic
                    congestion, aid crime solving, and impact daily life. Expectations lean towards
                    AI's generally positive societal impact, though challenges remain.</p>

                    In the last two decades, video games have transformed their purpose and
                    perception. Before 1994, they were primarily seen as time-wasting competitive
                    electronic amusements, often targeting teenage boys with spare change or parents
                    with gaming systems. This led many to dismiss them as mere digitized games,
                    arguing that if chess and basketball aren't considered art, neither should games
                    like Pong or Madden Football. Roger Ebert, a prominent film critic, vehemently
                    opposed the idea of video games as art from 2006 until his death in 2013,
                    stating that no game could compare to great poets, filmmakers, novelists, or
                    artists.

                Social media use has skyrocketed over the past decade and a half. Whereas only
                five percent of adults in the United States reported using a social media
                platform in 2005, that number is now around 70 percent.</p>

            <p>Though artificial intelligence is changing how businesses work, there are
                concerns about how it may influence our lives. This is not just an academic or a
                societal concern but a reputational risk for companies, no company wants to be
                marred with data or AI ethics scandals that impacted companies like Amazon. For
                example, there was significant backlash due to the sale of Rekognition to law
                enforcement. This was followed by Amazon’s decision to stop providing this
                technology to law enforcement for a year since they anticipate the proper legal
                framework to be in place by then.</p>

            <p>Just as the internet has drastically lowered the cost of information
                transmission, AI will lower the cost of cognition. That’s according to Harvard
                Business School professor Karim Lakhani, who has been studying AI and machine
                learning in the workplace for years. As the public comes to expect companies
                that deliver seamless, AI-enhanced experiences and transactions, leaders need to
                embrace the technology, learn to harness its potential, and develop use cases
                for their businesses. “The places where you can apply it?” he says. “Well, where
                do you apply thinking?”
